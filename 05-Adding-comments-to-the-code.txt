Section 02: Adding Comments to the Code
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to comment in a C program. The first way
is to use double forward slashes as the following example
illustrates:

Example 1

int main(void) {
	
	printf("This program single-line comments!"); // outputs a group of characters

	return 0;
}

Double forward slashes is for single line comments.


The second way is to use a forward slash followed by a star
with some text of your choosing followed by a star and a 
forward slash as the following example shows:

Example 2

int main(void) {

	printf("This program uses multi-line comments!");

	return 0;
}

One forward slash followed by two stars and another forward
slash is for multi-line comments.
