--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements

	1. Create a new source code file with a single
	   printf() statement in the main() function

	2. The statement must generate two lines of output
	   and include one word enclosed in double quotes

	3. Save the source code as a .c file

	4. Compile, build, and run program to test


Solution

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void) {

	printf("This is the first line.\nThis is the \"second\" line.\n");

	return 0;
}
