# Learning C

This repository contains the examples, exercises, and solutions for Section 01
of Learning C by Dan Gookin, which covers puts(), printf(), and scanf() functions,
new lines, escape sequences, variables, strings, and arithmetic.

<i>Please note, this repository is a work in progress and will be updated over time.</i>

In this repository, I incorporated Code::Blocks Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
and the Vim text editor along with Git and GitHub into my workflow. I also used the 
Fedora 37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and manage directories and
files as I worked through the section.

Please feel free to reach out to me at devildoc300@gmail.com if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the source code for your consumption and
edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile, build, and execute the Section 02 files and directories,

    (1) click on the blue "Code" button above and click the
        "Download Zip" link, or
    (2) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite,
        or Code::Blocks, for example, or your preferred text editor,
        Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example, and either
    (3) compile, build, and execute the files in your IDE, or
    (4) use the following command-line script:

            $ gcc name_of_file.c -o main
            $ ./main
